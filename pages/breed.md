## Exterior

The Siberian is a semi-longhair breed of cat. Their coat expresses the three natural types of feline fur: guard hairs, awn hairs, and down. Although brown tabby is the most common color, it may be any pattern or combination of colors. The longer hairs are pale near the skin, darkening toward the outer end. This makes the coat shimmer as the cat moves.


## Body

Powerfully built, strong, with well proportioned characteristics. They typically weigh between 15 to 20 pounds (6.8 to 9.1 kg) for males, or 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg) for females. Siberians attain their full growth more slowly, typically over their first 5 years.


## Temperament

The Siberian cat has a sweet personality to go with the sweet expression on its face. It is robust, and makes a loving, gentle and faithful companion. Breed rating on a scale of 1 to 10:
