## Allergy information

Hypoallergenic qualities of the Siberian coat have been noted and [commented on](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoallergenic).
Breeders and pet owners claim that Siberians can be hypoallergenic to many allergy sufferers. Since females of all feline breeds produce lower levels of
[Fel d1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fel_d1)
, breeders often suggest that allergic families adopted female cats. If you are allergic, it is best to check your reactivity directly with the parent cats from whom you plan to adopt a kitten. A 1999 Indoor Biotechnologies test result showed that the breed produces less `Fel d1`, the primary allergen present on cats.

Personally, I am allergic to cats and I have spent quite some time finding out which breed I can live with. None of the usual symptoms so far after a few years!

## Exterior

The Siberian is a semi-longhair breed of cat. Their coat expresses the three natural types of feline fur: guard hairs, awn hairs, and down. Although brown tabby is the most common color, it may be any pattern or combination of colors. The longer hairs are pale near the skin, darkening toward the outer end. This makes the coat shimmer as the cat moves.


## Body

Powerfully built, strong, with well proportioned characteristics. They typically weigh between 15 to 20 pounds (6.8 to 9.1 kg) for males, or 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg) for females. Siberians attain their full growth more slowly, typically over their first 5 years.


## Temperament

The Siberian cat has a sweet personality to go with the sweet expression on its face. It is robust, and makes a loving, gentle and faithful companion. Breed rating on a scale of 1 to 10:
