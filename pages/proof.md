# Steps to Siberian-proof your home

1. Avoid poisonous plants

Cats like to chew on grass and plants, but some of them are irritating, dangerous and even deadly to cats. Even non-poisonous plants can cause vomiting and diarrhea. Keep dangerous plants out of reach or, better yet, don't have them in the house. If your cat likes green stuff, purchase or grow your own cat grass.

2. Lock up cleaning supplies

Put child-proof latches on your cabinets to keep your cat from licking, chewing, or eating cleaning products. They contain dangerous chemicals.

3. Keep your cat from sipping his water from the toilet bowl

The main danger of your kitty drinking water from the toilet is the possible presence of toxic cleaners inside. Chemicals from toilet cleaning tablets placed inside the tank and residue from cleaners used to scrub the bowl, like chlorine bleach, can make your furry friend sick if he ingests them. In addition, if your little one is used to drinking toilet water, he won't realize he shouldn't be taking a sip when you're soaking the bowl with a cleaner. Any cleaners can be toxic to your little buddy, especially in larger amounts, some causing chemical burns of the mouth and throat.

4. Unplug your home

Unplug electrical cords when they aren't in use. If your cat's a chewer, she could be in for a nasty shock. You can also put cords in a cord protector or coat them with a bad-tasting substance such as hot sauce, wasabi or a non-toxic spray available at pet supply stores.

5. Check the dryer (and other places)

Look inside the dryer before closing the door, and keep it closed when not in use. Cats love to hole up in dark, quiet places, which can be a recipe for a tragedy. Kittens often climb into refrigerators, freezers and dresser drawers, so check these, too, before closing them.

6. Secure your screens

Make sure your screen door and window screens have secure, sturdy latches. Don't run the risk that your cat could slip out unnoticed.

7. Hanging cords for blinds

Cats enjoy batting around cords from hanging blinds. The danger is that they get tangled up and choke. Be sure to either anchor the cords or tie them up out of reach.

8. Little things

Rubber bands, coins, pins, erasers, thumbtacks, paper clips, deflated balloons. All of these can be enticing playthings but pose a choking hazard.

9. Unsecured doors

You don't want your cat to accidentally wander outside or get caught in a door slamming shut from a breeze. Swinging doors. These can trap a kittenâ€™s head and neck. Always check before closing the door.

10. An open fireplace. Avoid candles if you can.

Protect your cat from getting burned by using a secure fire screen. Fire will cause either fear or fascination in your kitten, and patting paws will get burned if he tries to catch the flame. Cats like warm places to sleep but also may use a fireplace as a toilet.

11. Long strings. Tooth floss.

If swallowed, they can damage the intestines or cause a blockage, requiring surgery.
Craft or sewing kits. These may hold needles and threads that can be swallowed, causing severe injury and illness.

12. Sharp objects such as knives.

Playing with knives that smell like food can also injure a curious cat.

13. Aspirin, Tylenol and Ibuprofen are deadly to cats.

14. Rocking chairs and especially recliners can cause severe injury to indoor cats. Be sure to check for cats before rocking in a rocking chair.

15. Plastic bags

Plastic is another high risk item. Cats love to chew on plastic, any kind of plastic! While plastic is usually thrown back up, it can cause choking or intestinal obstruction.
