Our cats come from some of the best Russian breeders:
the Lion's Heart ([Львиное Сердце](http://www.lvinserdce.ru/)),
Velikii Ohotnik ([Великий Охотник](http://velikiiohotnik.narod.ru/)) and
Iz Odissei ([Из Одиссеи](http://izodissei.ru/))
catteries in Moscow.
The selection has been made with genetic diversity in mind as one of the highest contributing factors to the purebred cats' health. All our kittens come with a health guarantee.

The cats always interact with people and see them as their companions. They never hesitate to express their playful mood and they always apologize if they feel they have to. They will run to you when you call them and they will greet you at the door, but still they understand you need your own space as long as you respect their own.
