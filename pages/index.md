We are an in-home cattery and Siberians are our passion. Our cats live in a friendly environment enjoying all the privileges of the members of the pack. We are located in the east of San Francisco Bay Area and you are always welcome to see the conditions. All our kittens are available for shipping.

Our Siberians come from the best Russian breeders:
the _Lion's Heart_ ([Львиное Сердце](http://www.lvinserdce.ru/)),
_Velikii Ohotnik_ ([Великий Охотник](http://velikiiohotnik.narod.ru/)) and
_Iz Odissei_ ([Из Одиссеи](http://izodissei.ru/))
catteries in Moscow.
The selection has been made with the genetic diversity in mind as one of the highest contributing factors to the purebred cat's health. All our kittens come with a health guarantee, CFA and TICA registered.

The cats always interact with people and see them as their companions. They never hesitate to express their playful mood and they always apologize if they feel they have to. They will run to you when you call them and they will greet you at the door, but still they understand you need your own space as long as you respect their own.
